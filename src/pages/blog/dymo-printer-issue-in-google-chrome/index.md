In the last few days we've had some of our users reporting that label printing with a DYMO isn't working. It seems that Google in the past week has started upgrading users from a 32bit version of Chrome to a 64bit version. It all sounds a bit techo but basically it means the DYMO printers aren't working for these users. We are working with DYMO to resolve this but in the mean time if you're experiencing this issue you'll need to use another web browser such as Firefox, Internext Explorer or Safari. You can find links to download one of these browsers at [www.browsehappy.com](http://www.browsehappy.com).
