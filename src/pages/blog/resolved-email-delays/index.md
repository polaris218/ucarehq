To ensure high email delivery rates (so that your email does not land in spam) UCare uses a major email delivery service. Unfortunately, we are currently experiencing delays sending email through this service. We are working with our email service provider to resolve the issue.

You rely on UCare for sending email so we apologize this inconvenience.

As we work with our email service provider to resolve the issue, we will update this article with more info.

### Update

We have resolved the email delay issue.
