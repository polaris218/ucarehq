A number of our customers that use Google Chrome have reported to us in the last few days that reporting options weren't working for them, the checkboxes seemed frozen and unresponsive. This was caused because Google released an update to Chrome (version 48) over the weekend, and this update had some unfortunate bugs that not only broke the reporting in UCare but also checkboxes on other websites.

The temporary solution was to use another web browser but thankfully we've been able to develop a workaround that fixes the reporting options. Google Chrome is normally such high quality that this caught us by surprise as much as it may have you, even so we want to apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused.

### Search speed improvements

For our customers that have more than 2000 people in UCare we've been working on performance. Now when searching or when checking people in you will notice that the speed is much improved. We have more work planned in regard to search so expect to see this to continue to improve.

With these and other updates we’re working hard to make UCare smarter and easier to use, if you have any feedback we’d love to hear from you, simply email support@ucarehq.com.
