## Stop people falling through the cracks

People at your church are going through difficult times, be it financial, health, relational or something else. Knowing when a person attends so that you know when they don’t is a key ingredient to showing them they’re valued.

## Track how people connect

UCare looks after requesting attendance reports from your small group leaders. Mark-off who was there, add notes and the report is done. Experience has shown that small group leaders often forget passwords so don’t submit attendance, that’s why we created a secure reporting method that avoids the need for passwords.

Your small group leaders can again help with service attendance or your connection team can pull up the app and mark-off the people that they welcomed. When it comes to ticketed events, open the app, scan tickets, check people in and print name tags. All this attendance info is then used to generate individual, group and church health reports, and allows you to proactively follow up with people.
